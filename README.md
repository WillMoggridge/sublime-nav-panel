# Nav Panel

Inspired on vim's netrw, shows a quick panel to open files within the current directory.

It's usefull when you want to quickly open files within the current buffer's directory, also you can navigate on directories without opening the side bar.

## Default key mapping
```
[
    {"keys": ["super+up"], "command": "open_nav_panel"},
]
```
